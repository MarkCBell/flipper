
Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on
laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates.

It can decide the Nielsen--Thurston type of a given mapping class and,
for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering
triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.

Flipper can be run as a Python 2, Python 3 or Sage Python module. Currently
it is fastest as a Sage Python module.


Flipper is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The preferred method
for installing the latest stable release is to use pip:
	> python -m pip install flipper --user --upgrade
Pip can be installed using get-pip.py from
	http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html
and is included in Python 3.4 by default.

Flipper can also be installed through the older easy_install:
	> python -m easy_install flipper

	> python -m flipper.doc
