
Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on 
laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates. 
Eventually it will also be able to construct the canonical triangulation 
of the surface bundle associated to pseudo-Anosov mapping class.

Flipper is available from:
