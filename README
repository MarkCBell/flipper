Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on laminations
on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates. It can decide the
Nielsen-Thurston type of a given mapping class and, for pseudo-Anosov mapping
classes, construct a layered, veering triangulation of their mapping torus, as
described by Agol.
