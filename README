
Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on
laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates.

It can decide the Nielsen--Thurston type of a given mapping class and,
for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering triangulation
of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.

Flipper can be run as a Python 2, Python 3 or Sage Python module.
