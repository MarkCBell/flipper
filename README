Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on curves 
and laminations on a punctured surface using ideal triangulation coordinates. 
Eventually it will also be able to construct the canonical triangulation of 
the surface bundle associated to pseudo-Anosov mapping class.

Flipper is available from:
