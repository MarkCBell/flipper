Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates.
It can decide the Nielsen--Thurston type of a given mapping class and, for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.

Flipper officially supports Python 2.7 and 3.5 -- 3.7.
It also runs on `Sage`_ which is currently the fastest way to run it.
If you need even more speed (~25% more) then consider running flipper with the -O optimise bytecode option.

.. note:: The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2.
    Consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production today.
    If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste. — *Kenneth Reitz*
