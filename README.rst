
Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on laminations
on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates. It can decide the
Nielsen-Thurston type of a given mapping class and, for pseudo-Anosov mapping
classes, construct a layered, veering triangulation of their mapping torus, as
described by Agol.

Flipper can be run as a Python 2, Python 3 or `Sage Python
<http://www.sagemath.org/>`_ module. Currently, it is fastest when run through
Sage. For even more speed (~25% more) consider running flipper with the -O
optimise bytecode option.
