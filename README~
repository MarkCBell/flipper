
Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on
laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates.

It can decide the Nielsen--Thurston type of a given mapping class and,
for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering
triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.

Flipper can be run as a Python 2, Python 3 or Sage Python module. Currently
it is fastest as a Sage Python module.


Flipper is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The preferred method
for installing the latest stable release is:
	> python -m pip install flipper-triangulation --user
If pip is not included in your version of Python then install it using
get-pip.py available at:
	http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html

Flipper can also be installed through the older easy_install:
	> python -m easy_install flipper-triangulation


For more information about installing and using flipper see "A users
guide to flipper" located at:
	./docs/flipper.pdf
Or run:
	> python -m flipper.help
