Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates.
It can decide the Nielsen-Thurston type of a given mapping class and, for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.

Flipper can be run as a Python 2, Python 3 or `Sage Python <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_ module.
Currently, it is fastest when run through Sage.
For even more speed (~25% more) consider running flipper with the -O optimise bytecode option.

.. note:: The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2.
	Consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production today.
	If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste. — *Kenneth Reitz*
