
### Application ###
undo and redo
handle commands better
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show algebraic intersection number
add examples to application/examples/
add import / export without triangulation
add version number compare in saves
arrow keys to move

### Documentation ###
more documentation
documentation for kernel - sphinx

### Kernel ###
make polynomials squarefree - polynomial gcd
remove all dependence on sage - Faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
laminations  / encodings should include / manipulate algebraic intersection number
be able to (half) twist along all curves
add set accuracy to AlgebraicApproximation
add support for Fractions to the number classes
doc strings everywhere
recheck ALL number theory bounds
add import / export

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module
switch to actual unit tests
