
### Application ###
undo and redo
handle commands better
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show algebraic intersection number

### Documentation ###
more / update all documentation
doc strings everywhere

### Kernel ###
make polynomials squarefree - polynomial gcd
remove all dependence on sage - Faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
laminations  / encodings should include / manipulate algebraic intersection number
be able to (half) twist along all curves
add set accuracy to AlgebraicApproximation
add support for Fractions to the number classes

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module
switch to unit tests
