
### Application ###
undo and redo
handle commands better
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show algebraic intersection number
add examples to application/examples/

### Documentation ###
more documentation
documentation for kernel - sphinx

### Kernel ###
make polynomials squarefree - polynomial gcd
remove all dependence on sage - Faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
laminations  / encodings should include / manipulate algebraic intersection number
be able to (half) twist along all curves
add set accuracy to AlgebraicApproximation
add support for Fractions to the number classes
doc strings everywhere

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module
switch to actual unit tests
