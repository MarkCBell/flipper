
undo and redo
handle commands better
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)

compute algebraic intersection number
create / use InputBox
update all documentation
more documentation
doc strings everywhere

do approximations manually
only use sage / sympy to factor a polynomial
remove all dependence on sage / smypy
add unit tests

add set accuracy to AlgebraicApproximation

Lamination should have an associated number field

be able to (half) twist along all curves
