''' A module for interacting with various symbolic calculation libraries.

This module selects and imports the appropriate interface for manipulating algebraic numbers.
Currently there is an interface to sage, cypari and a dummy library. A library should raise an
ImportError on import if it cannot be used. The dummy library can always be used, even in
Python 3.

There used to be an interface to SymPy but this turned out to be extremely unreliable. There
were 9x9 invertible matrices for which it could only find 1 eigenvalue!

The dummy library also includes a basic implementation of the gram-schmidt orthonormalisation
process and project function that other libraries may be able to make use of.

Each library provides one function:
    directed_eigenvector(action_matrix, condition_matrix, vector)

More interfaces can be added here. '''

    of its Galois conjugates.
