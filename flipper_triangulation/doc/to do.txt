### Application ###
undo and redo
autosave session
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show algebraic intersection number
update examples in application/examples/
add arrows showing edge orientation

### Documentation ###
documentation for kernel - sphinx?
document bad cases for default symbolic libarary
change `good curves' to `non-isolating curves'
redo installation / testing instructions
autogenerate docs / README
upload version with:
	python setup.py sdist register upload

### Kernel ###
deal with disconnected surfaces
extend symboliccomputation_dummy to work in all cases
make algebraicnumber (symboliccomputation_sage/PF_eigen2) faster
remove all dependence on sage - Faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
be able to (half) twist along all curves - construct chain - use H_1 code?
recheck ALL number theory bounds
Add function to convert Twister surface files to flipper.EquippedTriangulations
Rewrite AlgebraicNumber

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module

### Profiles ###
add better profiling to see speedup progress
