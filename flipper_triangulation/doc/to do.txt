### Application ###
undo and redo
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show algebraic intersection number
update examples in application/examples/

### Documentation ###
documentation for kernel - sphinx?
redo installation / testing instructions
upload version with:
	python setup.py sdist register upload

### Kernel ###
make algebraicnumber (symboliccomputation_sage/PF_eigen2) faster
remove all dependence on sage - Faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
laminations  / encodings should include / manipulate algebraic intersection number
be able to (half) twist along all curves - construct chain - use H_1 code?
recheck ALL number theory bounds
completing the square - problems come from the Birman subgroup, see:
	#surface, word, target = 'S_2_1', 'abCDEf', 'm160'
	#surface, word, target = 'S_2_1', 'abCDE', 'v2099'
Add function to convert Twister surface files to flipper.EquippedTriangulations
Rewrite AlgebraicNumber

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module

### Profiles ###
add better profiling to see speedup progress
