### Application ###
undo and redo
autosave session
fix keyboard shortcuts on mac
have weighted brush for painting laminations (in a given field?)
show arrows 2/3 of the way along edges
switch lamination drawing method on update
show warning when automatically adding peripheral components
show vertices as filled / unfilled
add ability to export a python script - exporting invariant laminations could be hard
need to be able to handle loading disconnected surfaces

### Documentation ###
document bad cases for default symbolic libarary
redo installation / testing instructions
autogenerate docs / README
upload version with:
	python setup.py sdist register upload

### Kernel ###
check we can completely handle disconnected surfaces
fix lamination.splitting_sequence by extending collapse
rescale invariant lamination such that weight is in [1, lamination)
extend symboliccomputation_dummy to work in all cases
faster Matrix.kernel
lamination should have an associated number field
be able to (half) twist along all curves - construct chain - use H_1 code?
recheck ALL number theory bounds
Add function to convert Twister surface files to flipper.EquippedTriangulations

### Tests ###
add more tests
tests for every module

### Profiles ###
add better profiling to see speedup progress
