''' The flipper kernel.

Some of the functions and methods have assumptions on them. We denote
in a functions docstring:
	Assumes that ...
		If the assumptions are met then this function is guaranteed to terminate correctly.
		If not then this function will either:
			terminate correctly, OR
			a flipper.AssumptionError will be raised.
	
	Assumes (and checks) that ...
		If the assumptions are met then this function is guaranteed to terminate correctly.
		If not then this a flipper.AssumptionError will be raised. '''
